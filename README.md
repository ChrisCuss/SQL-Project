# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Technology Used
	- PostgreSQL
	- pgAdmin
	- ChatGPT (For Syntax search and to help structure my readme writing Only)
	- Google Search

## Project/Goals

This project serves to show the application of the skills and concepts we learned throughout the first 6 weeks of the course. The objectives include:

	- Data Extraction: Retrieve data from a SQL database for further manipulation.
	- Data Transformation and Analysis: Clean and transform the raw data to facilitate insightful analysis.
	- Data Loading: Import the transformed data back into a database.
	- Quality Assurance: Implement a robust QA process to validate the transformed data against its raw counterpart.

## Process
### Step 1: Import data to PGadmin
### Step 2: Clean the data (Missing Values, Duplicates, Formatting, Outliers, etc)
### Step 3: 

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
